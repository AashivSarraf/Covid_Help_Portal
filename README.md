# Covid_Help_Portal
Developed a project covid help portal in Java.
Users can see the information related to covid like- total cases, recovered cases etc. of World, India, M.P and Indore. Additionally, people who are willing to help others and have availability of related equipment can add various kind of information like accessibility to Covid Injections, Fungus Injections, Oxygen, Tiffin Services, Plasma along with the prices of the respective things. Details of covid hospitals are also provided for additional help on the portal/site.
I hope you like it.
